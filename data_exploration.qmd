This page features our process for gathering, cleaning, and providing an initial exploratory analysis of the data used.

# Open Brewery DB

The driving dataset of our project, this was pulled via API from the Open Brewery DB [webiste](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).

## Data Cleaning

### Initial Dataset

### Cleaning Process

We first reviewed the countries available, and found cleaning and slicing on the country name column were warranted.

After applying a strip and lowercase on the country column, we filtered just for the United States, and then examined the null values.

With this amount of data and for the purposes of our project, we could probably remove the rows which don't contain a tier-1 address.

Most tier-2 and tier-3 addresses are missing, so let's just remove those columns.

Additionally, **street** is an identical column to **address_1** as is **state** to **state_province**. We can remove the duplicate columns.

After removing  nonessential rows and columns, we applied the strip and lowercase procedure on the remaining columns, and then reexamined the null values.

We decided to move forward with this data, and potentially massage any longitude/latitude data issues later. The phone and website_url columns will likely be irrelevant.

### Cleaned Dataset

## Data Exploration

Our initial observation of the data is that we are dealing almost primarily with categorical values.

A useful starting point in the visualizations would be to find the top-5 and bottom-5 for brewery counts by state, and then provide an overall heat map of the United States by brewery.
